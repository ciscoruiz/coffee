COFFEE
====

COFFEE is the acronym for "COmpany eFFEEctive Platform"


To create to release from this library you should use a c++ compiler which supports c++11
and you should have installed next packages:

  sudo apt-get install scons
  sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem-dev 
  sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev

Now you can run "scons" to create libraries or "scons test" to create libraries and run unit test
over that libraries.
