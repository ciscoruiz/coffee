# COFFEE

COFFEE is the acronym for "COmpany eFFEEctive platform"

## Getting started 

This project is a set of common libraries which help to improve productivity while developing from medium to huge C++ projects.

### Prerequisites

You should have to use a g++ with support for c++11.

And should have installed the next packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install scons
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-test-dev
```
For now it should be very simple.

### Installation

You can run "scons" from the coffee directory to create libraries or "scons test" to create libraries and 
run unit test over that libraries.
